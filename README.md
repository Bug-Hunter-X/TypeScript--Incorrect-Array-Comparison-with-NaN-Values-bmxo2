This repository demonstrates a common bug in TypeScript involving array comparison when NaN values are present.  The `compareArrays` function is designed to check if two number arrays are identical.  The issue arises because NaN !== NaN.  The solution provides a corrected version that handles NaN comparisons correctly.  This is a helpful example for understanding the nuances of handling NaN values in TypeScript.
